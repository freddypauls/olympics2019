This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a hobby project I made to learn React. But it is also ment for use at an actual event we are doing with a friend group. The project is made in React with firebase as backend. It allows users to make an account and log in, if you want to join a team you can say so on your profile page, and this will let the system know when making the teams. Teams are randomly generated in the code, and is controlled by the admin. The admin can start team generator, assign or delete teams, he/she can also assign team leaders or game adminds. Game admins control the game, but the only functionality this entails is to give out or remove points for the existing teams. Team page shows all teams, and leaders page gives out some info about the leaders. Teams page is build on team components that print out corresponding teams, and shows a leaderboard that will filter automatically with right placements. Leaders and home page are both static pages and need to be changed if content is to be different. Sign up and sign in happen through firebase, you can also recover passwords (as long as the email used to create your user is legit). Info page is the first page or the landing page as you might say, this page is a static page that "generates" or shows a animation of a star wars crawl. Here all the text and timings etc can be changed accrodingly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- ### `npm test`-->

<!-- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br> -->
<!--See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

<!--### `npm run build`
<!--<!--Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
<!--It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.-->

<!--The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>-->
<!--Your app is ready to be deployed!-->

<!--See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.-->

<!--### `npm run eject`-->

<!--**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**-->

<!--If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.-->

<!--Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

<!--You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. -->
